--[[	
		In computer software or authoring programs standards and documentation, 
		the term deprecation is applied to software features that are superseded 
		and should be avoided. Although deprecated features remain in the current 
		version, their use may raise warning messages recommending alternative practices, 
		and deprecation may indicate that the feature will be removed in the future. 
		Features are deprecated—rather than being removed—in order to provide 
		backward compatibility and give programmers who have used the feature time to
		bring their code into compliance with the new standard.
